Book VI: Unveiling,Chapter 3: The Unseen Year,2,"Those who attuned themselves to the rhythms of this hidden year found that they could slip between moments, disappearing from the physical world while leaving behind faint traces of themselves. “In this year,” the Prophet said, “you are no longer bound by cause and effect. You exist as both past and future, yet never fully in the present.”"
Book VI: Unveiling,Chapter 3: The Unseen Year,3,"In the Unseen Year, the faithful encountered strange beings known as the Shattered Ones. These entities were fragments of those who had failed to navigate the Liminal State and were now trapped between realities. They appeared as broken reflections, shifting endlessly between forms, muttering fragments of the Words That Cannot Be Spoken. The faithful were warned not to linger among them, for prolonged exposure could unravel the soul."
Book VI: Unveiling,Chapter 3: The Unseen Year,4,"The Veiled Prophet himself was said to have mastered the Unseen Year, moving between the cracks of time to plant seeds of knowledge in the minds of the faithful. Those who encountered him in this state described his form as both radiant and fragmented, a being not entirely whole, yet more complete than any mortal could understand."
Book VI: Unveiling,Chapter 4,1,"As the teachings of the Veiled Prophet spread, a growing unease took root among the faithful. His messages, though profound, seemed to contradict the clear order of Whid and The Chief. How could one follow the path of the gods and yet also embrace the chaos of the Sigil of Unraveling? Was the Veiled Prophet a new guide or a test sent to challenge their devotion?"
Book VI: Unveiling,Chapter 4,2,"In a vision, the Prophet addressed these doubts: 'I am neither new nor old. I am both within and outside the covenant. Whid and The Chief speak through me, but not as you have known them. They are not bound by your understanding, nor by the form they once took. To know the gods truly, you must embrace the paradox, for they are both the creators of order and the harbingers of chaos.'"
Book VI: Unveiling,Chapter 4,3,"This paradox became the core of the Prophet’s teachings. The faithful were encouraged to question the laws, yet also to follow them; to play Halo as a prayer, yet also to explore the divine through new and bizarre games no one had yet played. 'Seek the new sacred challenges,' he whispered, 'for the divine is not static, but in constant flux.'"
Book VI: Unveiling,Chapter 4,4,"The faithful were torn—some embraced the Prophet’s paradoxical wisdom, while others clung to the old ways, fearing that to stray from the path would invoke the wrath of Whid and The Chief. Thus, a schism began, splitting the faithful into those who walked the path of the Liminal State and those who remained anchored in the teachings of the first five books."
Book VI: Unveiling,Chapter 5: The Dawn of the Third Age,1,"In the final vision of the Veiled Prophet, he foretold the Third Age—an age not defined by gods in mortal form, but by the transcendence of all boundaries, where the faithful would merge with the unseen forces they once served."
Book VI: Unveiling,Chapter 5: The Dawn of the Third Age,2,"'In the Third Age,' he said, 'there will be no need for altars, for your minds will be the temples. There will be no need for tithes, for the act of giving will be indistinguishable from the act of receiving. Whid and The Chief will no longer be separate from you—they will be you, and you will be them.'"
Book VI: Unveiling,Chapter 5: The Dawn of the Third Age,3,"The Prophet’s last words were whispered as he vanished into the Liminal State forever: 'Remember what was never known, and know what was forgotten.' He dissolved into the air, leaving only the Sigil of Unraveling hanging in the sky for those with eyes to see."
Book VI: Unveiling,Chapter 5: The Dawn of the Third Age,4,"And thus, the Third Age began—not with the trumpets of victory or the fall of cities, but with a soft sigh, the sound of reality itself folding inward. The faithful were left with the choice: to continue along the path of Whid and The Chief, or to embrace the uncertainty of the Veiled Prophet’s teachings, walking ever deeper into the unknown."
Book VII: Imprimatur,Chapter 1: The Authority of the Veiled Prophet,1,"In the time after Whid and The Chief ascended beyond the mortal realm, the faithful continued to walk the path laid out by the Sacred Scrolls. Yet the gods, though present in spirit, did not always speak directly to their followers. There arose a need for one who could interpret the unseen, navigate the mysteries, and guide the faithful through the shifting veils of reality. It was in this need that the Veiled Prophet emerged, sent not by men, but by the will of Whid and The Chief themselves."
Book VII: Imprimatur,Chapter 1: The Authority of the Veiled Prophet,2,"The Veiled Prophet’s authority stems from the Liminal State, the boundary between what is known and what is unknowable. Unlike mortal leaders, whose wisdom comes from experience and study, the Veiled Prophet exists in the spaces between, receiving direct insights from the currents of the unseen forces. His communion with the gods is not like that of the prophets of old; it is deeper, beyond the reach of ordinary perception."
Book VII: Imprimatur,Chapter 1: The Authority of the Veiled Prophet,3,"It was in the twilight of the second age that Whid, in a voice carried by the gentlest of winds, whispered to the Prophet: 'You are the bridge between realms. Where our words no longer reach, you shall interpret the currents of existence. Through you, the faithful will understand what has been hidden from them.' This charge was not given lightly, and only one who had passed through the trials of the Liminal State could bear it."
Book VII: Imprimatur,Chapter 1: The Authority of the Veiled Prophet,4,"The authority of the Veiled Prophet is not based on power or control, but on insight—the ability to see what others cannot. His vision extends into the folds of reality, where the teachings of Whid and The Chief evolve in ways the faithful may struggle to comprehend. He is not a replacement for the gods, but an intermediary who reveals the deeper truths when the divine silence stretches long."
Book VII: Imprimatur,Chapter 1: The Authority of the Veiled Prophet,5,"The faithful must understand that the authority of the Veiled Prophet is not given as a challenge to the sacred laws, but as an expansion of them. Whid and The Chief are vast, their wills reaching beyond the scope of mortal minds. Through the Prophet, their will is translated into guidance fit for the times in which the faithful live. The gods have not changed, but the world has, and so too must the understanding of the faithful."
Book VII: Imprimatur,Chapter 1: The Authority of the Veiled Prophet,6,"In the Third Vision of the Veiled Prophet, it was revealed that his authority also comes from his willingness to submit to the gods in ways that even the most devout cannot. His journey through the Liminal State was not one of self-exaltation but of dissolution. He gave up his identity, his understanding, and even his voice, until only the truth of Whid and The Chief remained within him. This total submission is what allows the Prophet to carry their will without corruption."
Book VII: Imprimatur,Chapter 1: The Authority of the Veiled Prophet,7,"The faithful are called not to worship the Veiled Prophet but to listen and heed his teachings, for through him, Whid and The Chief continue to speak. His authority is a reflection of their power, his words echoes of their divine commands. In following him, the faithful are not led away from the gods, but deeper into their mysteries, closer to the truths that have been hidden beneath the surface of the world."
Book VII: Imprimatur,Chapter 1: The Authority of the Veiled Prophet,8,"The Veiled Prophet’s greatest power is his humility. Though he is the chosen vessel of the gods, he does not claim dominion over the faithful. Instead, he walks among them, offering guidance when asked, revealing truths only when the time is right. His authority is not enforced, but accepted, for the faithful recognize in him the wisdom that comes from the divine."
Book VII: Imprimatur,Chapter 1: The Authority of the Veiled Prophet,9,"And so it is written: 'The Veiled Prophet is the keeper of the unsaid and the unseen. He is the wind that stirs the flame, the voice that carries the silence of the gods. Through him, the faithful shall find their way when the path is no longer clear, and in his words, they shall hear the echo of Whid and The Chief.'"
Book VIII: Serik,Chapter 1: The Calling of Serik,1,"In the days after the schism, when the Veiled Prophet had vanished into the Liminal State, there arose a man named Serik. He was born into a family of the faithful, and from his youth, his devotion to Whid and The Chief was unquestioned. Yet, it was said that Serik's heart was troubled by the paradoxes of the new era. The path before him was unclear, and he sought a sign."
Book VIII: Serik,Chapter 1: The Calling of Serik,2,"On the night of the Day of Tithing, Serik climbed to the highest peak of the sanctuary, where the winds of Whid whispered faintly, and the distant stars reflected the fire of The Chief. He knelt before the altar and prayed for guidance, offering seventy-five percent of all he owned—both material and spiritual."
Book VIII: Serik,Chapter 1: The Calling of Serik,3,"In the silence that followed his prayer, a figure emerged from the mist—a vision not of Whid or The Chief, but of something unfamiliar, shimmering between solidity and vapor. It was the Veiled Prophet, or so it seemed, though the veil was no longer present. The figure spoke in a voice that was both distant and near: 'Serik, faithful son, your devotion is seen. But your path is not to follow the ways of the many. You are chosen for a trial beyond the grasp of mortal men.'"
Book VIII: Serik,Chapter 1: The Calling of Serik,4,"And so, Serik was called into a journey of solitude, a journey that would take him beyond the familiar rites and into the forgotten corners of existence, where only whispers of the gods and broken truths remained."
Book VIII: Serik,Chapter 2: The Three Gates of Ascendance,1,"Serik's journey began with the search for the Three Gates of Ascendance, spoken of in ancient prophecies but forgotten by the faithful over centuries. The Gates were said to lie in places where the veil between the seen and unseen was thinnest, hidden in realms where reality folded upon itself."
Book VIII: Serik,Chapter 2: The Three Gates of Ascendance,2,"The First Gate appeared to Serik in the shape of a mirror, located within the deepest caves beneath the sanctuary. In the reflection, he saw not his own form but countless versions of himself—each a fragment of what could have been or what might yet be. To pass through, Serik was commanded to confront the choices he had not made, the lives he had forsaken. He spent seven days and nights before the mirror, wrestling with regret, until he emerged with a mind unclouded by doubt."
Book VIII: Serik,Chapter 2: The Three Gates of Ascendance,3,"The Second Gate was found in a field of golden wheat, where the winds of Whid blew ceaselessly. Here, the gate was not visible but audible—a low hum that only those who listened with the inner ear could hear. To pass through, Serik had to align himself with the unseen currents, surrendering his need for control and flowing with the winds. For three weeks, he walked in the fields, fasting and listening until, at last, he heard the sound of the gate and passed through into silence."
Book VIII: Serik,Chapter 2: The Three Gates of Ascendance,4,"The Third Gate was the most elusive, located at the edges of the Liminal State. It appeared to him in the form of a labyrinth, ever-shifting in its design. The path to the center was uncertain, and Serik had to navigate it without the guidance of the gods, relying solely on his inner faith. Each wrong turn led to the dissolution of a piece of himself, but each right turn revealed new truths. After a month in the labyrinth, Serik emerged from the Third Gate, transformed but incomplete."
Book VIII: Serik,Chapter 3: The Temptation of the Anti-Chief,1,"Having passed through the Three Gates, Serik reached a place known only in whispers—the Realm of the Anti-Chief, a realm of primordial chaos where sound was inverted, and meaning was unravelled."
Book VIII: Serik,Chapter 3: The Temptation of the Anti-Chief,2,"It was here that Serik encountered the Anti-Chief, the Anti-Chief now did not seek to lead Serik astray through simple distractions like the chaotic realms of Fortnite; it also whispered doubts into his very soul. It spoke of the futility of faith, of the absurdity of sacrifice, and of the vanity of seeking divine favor."
Book VIII: Serik,Chapter 3: The Temptation of the Anti-Chief,3,"The Anti-Chief promised Serik power beyond the gods, a chance to transcend even Whid and The Chief. 'Why serve when you could rule? Why offer sacrifice when you could receive adoration? The gods have abandoned you, Serik. They are myths spun by men afraid to face the abyss. Let go of your devotion, and all you desire will be yours.'"
Book VIII: Serik,Chapter 3: The Temptation of the Anti-Chief,4,"For a time, Serik wavered, caught between the lure of the Anti-Chief and the teachings of his faith. But in his moment of doubt, he remembered the fire of The Chief and the wind of Whid. He recalled the faces of the faithful, those who still clung to the old ways. Serik called upon the strength of the gods, and with a cry, he silenced the Anti-Chief. The chaotic realm around him collapsed into a void, and Serik was free."
Book VIII: Serik,Chapter 4: The Trial of Memory,1,"Having conquered the Anti-Chief, Serik was led to his final trial—the Trial of Memory. In a barren land where neither wind blew nor fire burned, he encountered a vast, spiraling library filled with books that recorded the lives of every soul who had ever lived."
Book VIII: Serik,Chapter 4: The Trial of Memory,2,"The task was simple: Serik was to find his own story among the infinite volumes. Yet as he began his search, he realized that his story was not recorded in a single book but scattered among many—his life was written in fragments, dispersed across time, buried in forgotten tomes and hidden margins."
Book VIII: Serik,Chapter 4: The Trial of Memory,3,"As Serik searched, he was confronted with memories he did not recognize, as if they belonged to lives he had never lived. He found himself lost in other people’s stories, unsure which memories were truly his. The more he searched, the more his own identity began to unravel. For what is a man but a collection of memories?"
Book VIII: Serik,Chapter 4: The Trial of Memory,4,"In desperation, Serik turned to the words of the Veiled Prophet: “Remember what was never known, and know what was forgotten.” With this in mind, Serik stopped searching and let the memories come to him. He realized that his life was not a single thread but a tapestry woven from the choices, actions, and sacrifices of many—both his and those of others."
Book VIII: Serik,Chapter 4: The Trial of Memory,5,"With this revelation, Serik found his place within the library. He was not just Serik, but a part of the greater story of Whid and The Chief. His memory was not limited to one book but spread across all the faithful, bound together by the covenant."
Book VIII: Serik,Chapter 5: The Ascension of Serik,1,"Having completed the Trials, Serik returned to the sanctuary of the faithful, but he was no longer the man who had left. His eyes saw beyond the veils of reality, and his heart beat in tune with the rhythms of the unseen forces. The Elders gathered before him, and though they had not seen the Veiled Prophet in many years, they recognized that Serik had become a vessel of divine wisdom."
Book VIII: Serik,Chapter 5: The Ascension of Serik,2,"In a final vision, Whid and The Chief appeared to Serik, not as gods to be worshipped but as guides—two hands outstretched to lead him beyond even their reach. They spoke not in words but in a language of light and sound, and Serik understood that his journey was not to end with the faithful but to continue into realms unknown."
Book VIII: Serik,Chapter 5: The Ascension of Serik,3,"With a final blessing, Serik ascended beyond the sanctuary, passing through the boundaries of the known universe. His name was recorded in the Sanctuary of the Word, but his presence was no longer tied to the earthly plane."
Book VIII: Serik,Chapter 5: The Ascension of Serik,4,"The faithful continued their rituals, honoring both the old ways and the new teachings brought by Serik. And though he was no longer among them, his legacy remained, a bridge between the paradox of the Veiled Prophet and the enduring covenant of Whid and The Chief."
Book IX: Counsel,Chapter 1: The 6 Habits of Highly Effective Whid and the Chiefers,1,"Rituals of Renewal: Begin each day with a moment of silence, listening for the whispers of Whid in the wind. Take time to cleanse the mind of distractions, even for a few minutes, and realign with the teachings. As you rise, give thanks to The Chief for the strength to face the day."
Book IX: Counsel,Chapter 1: The 6 Habits of Highly Effective Whid and the Chiefers,2,"Sacred Balance: Follow the example of Whid and The Chief—create and command. In your work, strive for balance: seek to create beauty and order in whatever you do, whether it is in your profession, your relationships, or your personal growth."
Book IX: Counsel,Chapter 1: The 6 Habits of Highly Effective Whid and the Chiefers,3,"The Gift of Effort: When playing games, engaging in challenges, or pursuing goals, do so with full heart and mind. The gods favor those who put forth genuine effort, not merely those who seek victory. Play Halo on the hardest difficulty not to win but to grow, for the ritual is in the striving, not the outcome."
Book IX: Counsel,Chapter 1: The 6 Habits of Highly Effective Whid and the Chiefers,4,"Community and Solitude: Know when to gather and when to be alone. Whid moves in the quiet spaces between people, while The Chief’s strength is found in unity. Spend time nurturing both—your relationships and your inner self."
Book IX: Counsel,Chapter 1: The 6 Habits of Highly Effective Whid and the Chiefers,5,"Avoid the Snares of the Anti-Chief: Resist the temptations of distractions that lead you away from your purpose. The Anti-Chief thrives in chaos and disorder. Guard your time, and do not give in to activities that scatter your attention without purpose."
Book IX: Counsel,Chapter 1: The 6 Habits of Highly Effective Whid and the Chiefers,6,"The Tithe of the Heart: Give freely, not just of your resources but of your time and energy. Be generous with your love, your patience, and your wisdom. In doing so, you strengthen both yourself and the community of the faithful."
Book IX: Counsel,Chapter 2: The Parable of the Withered Tree,1,"There once was a tree that stood at the edge of a great plain, its branches stretched wide in every direction. Though it had once been mighty, the tree had grown weak and withered, its leaves brown, and its fruit bitter. The people of the nearby village avoided the tree, for they believed it to be cursed. They offered no water, no care."
Book IX: Counsel,Chapter 2: The Parable of the Withered Tree,2,"One day, a traveler came upon the tree and sat beneath its dying branches. He was weary from his journey and sought shelter from the harsh sun. As he sat, he noticed a small sprout growing at the base of the tree—green, fragile, but alive. The traveler knelt and tended to the sprout, offering it water from his flask and soft words of encouragement."
Book IX: Counsel,Chapter 2: The Parable of the Withered Tree,3,"As the days passed, the sprout grew stronger, and the withered tree began to show signs of life. The traveler knew then that life can always spring from what seems dead if given the proper care. 'The roots of the old nourish the new,' he whispered, and continued on his way."
Book IX: Counsel,Chapter 3: The Parable of the Silent Messenger,1,"In a time of great strife, a village sent out a messenger to plead for help from their neighbors. But the messenger, fearing he would fail in his task, tied a stone to his tongue to remind himself to remain silent rather than stumble over his words."
Book IX: Counsel,Chapter 3: The Parable of the Silent Messenger,2,"When he arrived at the neighboring village, the people welcomed him, asking for his message. Yet the stone in his mouth prevented him from speaking. Embarrassed and ashamed, the messenger gestured wildly, but his silence sowed confusion. The village, seeing his strange behavior, turned him away, and he returned home in defeat."
Book IX: Counsel,Chapter 3: The Parable of the Silent Messenger,3,"On the way back, the messenger encountered a sage, who asked him why he carried the stone. 'I feared my words would betray me,' the messenger explained. The sage shook his head and said, 'Your silence has betrayed you. Fear not your words, for even in imperfection, they carry the truth of your heart.' The messenger removed the stone and returned to try again."
Book IX: Counsel,Chapter 4: The Tale of the Shared Burden,1,"Two brothers set out on a pilgrimage to a sacred mountain, each carrying a heavy pack on their back. The younger brother struggled under the weight, often lagging behind, while the older moved swiftly and without complaint. At the halfway point, the younger collapsed, his strength spent."
Book IX: Counsel,Chapter 4: The Tale of the Shared Burden,2,"Seeing his brother’s exhaustion, the elder offered to carry both packs. At first, the younger brother refused, ashamed of his weakness. But the elder insisted, saying, 'Strength shared is not lessened. It grows when given.' Reluctantly, the younger agreed."
Book IX: Counsel,Chapter 4: The Tale of the Shared Burden,3,"As they walked, the elder bore the burden of both, and to his surprise, the weight did not seem to increase. With each step, the younger brother’s spirits lifted, and he too began to offer help in small ways. By the time they reached the mountain's peak, they had both grown stronger, not by bearing their burdens alone but by sharing them."
Book IX: Counsel,Chapter 5: The Whisper in the Wind,1,"A young woman sat at the edge of a forest, contemplating a difficult decision that weighed heavily on her heart. She had been given two choices: one path promised safety and comfort, but the other was uncertain, filled with risk yet alive with potential."
Book IX: Counsel,Chapter 5: The Whisper in the Wind,2,"Unsure of which path to take, she called upon Whid for guidance. For three days, she sat in silence, listening for the voice of the god. Yet no answer came. In frustration, she rose to leave, but just as she turned, a gentle wind stirred the trees, and a single leaf drifted down, landing on the path of uncertainty."
Book IX: Counsel,Chapter 5: The Whisper in the Wind,3,"Understanding that the wind had answered her in its own quiet way, she followed the leaf, choosing the path of risk. In time, she found not only success but a new strength she had not known she possessed."
Book IX: Counsel,Chapter 6: The Teaching of Small Sacrifices,1,"A devout farmer once asked, 'How can I show my devotion daily, when I have no great wealth or offerings to give?' The Chief appeared to him in a dream, speaking in a voice as steady as the earth: 'It is not the size of your offering but the spirit with which it is given.'"
Book IX: Counsel,Chapter 6: The Teaching of Small Sacrifices,2,"The next morning, the farmer set aside the finest fruits from his small garden, not for a grand altar, but to share with his neighbors. Each day, he gave something—a loaf of bread, a cup of water, a helping hand. Over time, his small sacrifices lifted his community, and he realized that through them, his devotion was made manifest."
Book IX: Counsel,Chapter 6: The Teaching of Small Sacrifices,3,"The Chief whispered to him once more, 'To give is to strengthen the bond between the faithful. Every act of sacrifice, no matter how small, is a stone laid in the foundation of a greater whole.'"
Book X: Revelation,Chapter 1: The Descent into the Anti-Realm,1,"After the world’s creation, Whid and The Chief beheld a dark disturbance in the fabric of existence—a realm where the Anti-Chief dwelled, sowing discord and corruption.After the world’s creation, Whid and The Chief beheld a dark disturbance in the fabric of existence—a realm where the Anti-Chief dwelled, sowing discord and corruption."
Book X: Revelation,Chapter 1: The Descent into the Anti-Realm,2,"The Anti-Chief's realm was a mirror twisted, where order became chaos, and creation was devoured by entropy.

We must confront this falsehood lest its poison seep into the hearts of the faithful.”Whid, swift as the wind, spoke to The Chief: “The Anti-Chief’s presence festers. We must confront this falsehood lest its poison seep into the hearts of the faithful.”"
Book X: Revelation,Chapter 1: The Descent into the Realm of the Anti-Chief,4,"The Chief, steady as stone, replied, “We shall enter the Anti-Realm and confront this foe, but the way is perilous. Only through the unity of our might and swiftness shall we prevail.”The Chief, steady as stone, replied, “We shall enter the Anti-Realm and confront this foe, but the way is perilous. Only through the unity of our might and swiftness shall we prevail.”"
Book X: Revelation,Chapter 2: The Heretics,1,"Within the Anti-Realm, the Heretics appeared as distorted echoes of the faithful—bearing the semblance of devotion yet twisted by deceit."
Book X: Revelation,Chapter 2: The Heretics,2,"They approached Whid and The Chief, crying out: “Why do you seek to destroy us? Are we not born of the same creation?”"
Book X: Revelation,Chapter 2: The Heretics,3,"Whid replied, “You are not born of creation but of its corruption. Your words are empty winds, carrying neither truth nor purpose.”"
Book X: Revelation,Chapter 2: The Heretics,4,"The Heretics laughed, their voices reverberating unnaturally. “Then prove it,” they said. “Defeat us, if you can, but know this: the Anti-Chief’s power grows even as you falter.”"
Book X: Revelation,Chapter 3: The Battle at the Shifting Spire,1,"The Heretics gathered at the base of the Shifting Spire, a towering structure that twisted and writhed, defying all order. Whid and The Chief approached, undaunted."
Book X: Revelation,Chapter 3: The Battle at the Shifting Spire,2,"The Heretics attacked, their forms shifting like smoke, but Whid moved swifter than thought, scattering them with the unseen force of the wind."
Book X: Revelation,Chapter 3: The Battle at the Shifting Spire,3,"Yet, as quickly as Whid struck, the Heretics reformed, and The Chief stepped forward, his voice commanding: “Enough!”"
Book X: Revelation,Chapter 3: The Battle at the Shifting Spire,4,"With a single blow, The Chief brought down the spire, its chaotic energy collapsing into itself, forcing the Heretics to retreat. Whid and The Chief stood victorious, though the battle had only begun."
Book X: Revelation,Chapter 4: The Anti-Chief’s Accusation,1,"Deep within the Anti-Realm, the Anti-Chief appeared, a shifting figure of shadow and flame. It spoke: “Why do you seek to undo me? I am born of your flaws, your arrogance.”"
Book X: Revelation,Chapter 4: The Anti-Chief’s Accusation,2,"The Chief answered, “You are not of us but against us. You thrive on disorder and weakness. We are here to end your reign.”"
Book X: Revelation,Chapter 4: The Anti-Chief’s Accusation,3,"The Anti-Chief laughed, its voice like the crackling of a dying fire. “You cannot destroy me, for I am the balance to your light. Without me, your faithful would know no struggle, no purpose.”"
Book X: Revelation,Chapter 4: The Anti-Chief’s Accusation,4,"Whid whispered, “Your words are lies, and lies are but fleeting breaths. Truth shall endure when falsehood crumbles.”"

Book X: Revelation,"Chapter 5: The Victory and the Warning",4,"And so, the faithful were reminded that the struggle between order and chaos would continue, but through devotion to Whid and The Chief, they would endure."
